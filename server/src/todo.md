I want to use the data.mock.ts to mock the data. 

The data.mock.ts is a mock data for the database.

The jwt.config.ts is the config for the jwt.

I want to implment the below endpoints for the auth.controller.ts.

1. sign-in: return the access token and set the refresh token in the cookie.
2. sign-out: revoke the refresh token.
3. me: return the current user's information.
